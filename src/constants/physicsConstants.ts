/**
 * Physics constants for Work Mode scrap interactions.
 * 
 * WORLD UNITS SYSTEM:
 * - All physics calculations use world units (wu)
 * - World size: 20w × 10h (width × height)
 * - Positions: world units (0-20 X, 0-10 Y)
 * - Velocities: world units per second (wu/s)
 * - Forces: world units (arbitrary scale matched to mass)
 * 
 * Rationale: World units provide consistent physics behavior across all
 * screen sizes, resolutions, and aspect ratios. The camera system handles
 * conversion between world units and screen pixels.
 * 
 * Coordinate conversion is handled by src/constants/cameraConstants.ts:
 * - screenToWorld() - converts screen pixels to world coordinates
 * - worldToScreen() - converts world coordinates to screen pixels
